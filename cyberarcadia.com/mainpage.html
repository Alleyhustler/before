<h3>UPDATES:</h3>
<div id="text" class="textbox">
<p><b>3/29/2025:</b> I can't decide on a permanent background. I'm still trying stuff out.</p>
<p><b>3/4/2025:</b> I changed the background again, LOL. All of the GIMP concrete texture tutorials I could find were 12+ years old and didn't apply to the current version, so I just sort of had to figure it out. Basically: new image, filter > render > noise > plasma, mess around with the turbulence slider until it has enough turbulence, colors > desaturate > desaturate, new layer, fill the new layer with dark gray and set it on top, play around with different layer modes until you get an effect you like, CTRL+M to merge, filter > map > tile seamless, Filter > Edge Detect > Image Gradient, done.</p>
<p><b>3/2/2025:</b> Added the Updates content to the Mainpage. </p>
<p><b>2/17/2025:</b> Well. It's just over three years since my last update on this page, and things are not going well on a national and global front. On a personal front, I went and changed the look and feel of this website again. It was orginally supposed to reflect all of my interests, but it kind of ended up being a Matrix fansite instead. I plan on remedying that shortly. EDIT: unless I missed a couple, all of the images on this site are now alt-tagged for screen readers. I'm redoing <a href="https://cyberalfheim.info/">Cyber Alfheim</a> again, and so I'll be alt-tagging the images there as well.</p>
<p><b>1/30/2022:</b> <i>Matrix Resurrections</i> dropped, the new year dropped, and I redesigned the site again. This is all still a work in progress, as I reaffirm the original mission statement that led me to create it in the first place - an escape from the Web 2.0 Social Media "Walled Gardens" of Facebook and Twitter, and as a stab in the dark against the idea of a "Web 3" where literally everyone and everything is commodified.</p>

<p><b>2/14/2020:</b> The general look and feel of the site is pulled together, and one <a href="matrix.html">essay</a> is done. I'm offically declaring the site "open."</p>
