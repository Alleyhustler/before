<h3>UPDATES:</h3>
<div id="text" class="textbox">
<p><b>3/29/2025:</b> Still can’t decide on a permanent vibe for the chart background. One day it’s stone tablets, the next day it’s cosmic static. The Coin hasn’t even dropped yet and the aesthetic wars have already begun.</p>
<p><b>3/4/2025:</b> Changed the banner again, LOL. All the “ancient gold texture” tutorials online were for Photoshop CS2 or older, so I had to improvise. Ended up mixing noise, turbulence, and some desaturated relic patterns until it looked like something dug up from a pre-coin civilization. Perfectly inaccurate.</p>
<p><b>3/2/2025:</b> Added the Before The Coin lore section to the main page. This is where we document all the myths, lies, and half-truths leading up to the first mint.</p>
<p><b>2/17/2025:</b> Three years in the making, and we’re still technically “before the coin.” The plan was always to capture the last days of the pre-coin era — a world where value was still an idea, not a ticker. Also re-tagged all images for our future archaeologists. The history must be accessible.</p>
<p><b>1/30/2022:</b> The year the whispers started. A handful of traders began passing stories about “the coin that doesn’t exist yet.” No chart. No market cap. Just faith and curiosity. Before The Coin was born in the dark, away from the exchange lights.</p>
<p><b>2/14/2020:</b> The prophecy written: *“Before the first block is minted, the legend must be told.”* This site went live as the archive of that legend. The gates are now open.</p>
